This is a straightforward snake game made in pygame with a skin added to it.

The game consists of 3 scripts.
1. "snake_game.py": the main game script with the typical pygame structure.
2. "snake.py": the snakes script that contains the snakes logic(growing, colliding etc.).
3. "snake_rotation.py": the turn script that contains the logic for when the snakes skin should rotate and be applied.
