this is a fairly straighforward snake game made in pygame with a skin added to it.
the game consists of 3 scripts.
1. the main game script with the typical pygame structure.
2. the snakes script that contains the snakes logic(growing, colliding etc).
3. the turn script that contains the logic for when the snakes skin should rotate and be applied.
